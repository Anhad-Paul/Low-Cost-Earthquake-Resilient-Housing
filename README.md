# Low Cost Earthquake Resilient Housing

Executive Summary

Nepal is a country that experiences frequent seismic movements which causes significant damage to
buildings. This report introduces a design for a low-cost earthquake resilient house for the victims of the
Nepal earthquake. The design incorporates four main features which allow it to be earthquake proof:

• The walls of the house are made of compressed stabilised earth bricks (CSEB), these are made
from local materials (i.e. soil, gravel, slit, cement).

• The walls are reinforced using iron bars which will be inserted inside the CSEB walls to strengthen
the structure of the house.

• Bambusa Balcooa bamboos are attached in between the walls to resist any horizontal seismic
movements, this feature can withstand 445603.5N when being compressed.

• The house is built on top of a rigid flat foundation made of stone. This aids the stability of the
house during seismic movements.

To maintain a comfortable temperature inside the house when the outdoor temperature fluctuates
between -10℃ and 30℃, we used materials with high thermal mass (low heat absorption) such as
thatched roofing and earth bricks.

This low-cost earthquake resilient house meets all the requests from the clients, the simple design
structure allows uneducated labours to be able to build it. Moreover, all materials are found locally which
means no further cost will be needed for transportation and this keeps the price under the budget of
5000 NZD. Thus, this earthquake resilient house is highly recommended to be built in the mountainous
area of Nepal.

The final recommended design is the shell of a house with a single common area, this report assumes the
use of communal kitchens and bathrooms in the village it will be situated in. This corresponds with the
lack of amenities included in the design.
